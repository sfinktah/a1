NOTE: The folder ../CardGameGuiUltimate contains a visually enhanced and 
optimised version of this project, but is not being submitted due to the
excessive code size.  (It implements a debouncing function, tweened 
card animations, bitmap caching, draggable cards on a JLayeredPane, and
is a most beautiful user experience.  You are encouraged to view the results
for the sheer joy of doing so.

The folder ../CardGameGui contains the version of this project intended
for marking.

To test other implementations of BlackEngineImpl, simply place the  
implementation into ../CardGame/src/model/ and compile the project in
../CardGameGui.

To implement this GUI extension to your own A1 style project, you can add 
all file and folders in the CardGameGui/res/* and CardGameGui/src/ folders 
(besides the one in src/client), and copy the functionality of 
client/SimpleTestClient.java
